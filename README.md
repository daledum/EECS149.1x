# EECS149.1x
Programming (in C) a robotic controller in a virtual laboratory environment, as part of the Edx hosted MOOC, UC Berkeley EECS149.1x Cyber-Physical Systems.

The design goal for what you will be working on is this: to modify the iRobot CreateÂ® to autonomously navigate the
top of an incline, avoiding cliffs and obstacles along the way.

irobotNavigationStatechart_navigation.c
Create a state machine in C using Microsoft Visual Studio. Your state machine will read sensors and drive the iRobot Create with a basic
sense of orientation while avoiding obstacles in a simulated environment.

irobotNavigationStatechart_hill.c
Using Microsoft Visual Studio, you will implement a state machine in C that instructs the iRobot Create to navigate to the top of an incline while avoiding cliffs
and obstacles in a simulated environment.

SW Tools:
Microsoft Visual Studion/LabVIEW Robotics Environment Simulator/CyberSim
